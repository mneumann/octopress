In the year 2002 I have been working for [Syngress Publishing][syngress] (now
Elsevier) as a Technical Editor for their book 
[Ruby Developer's Guide][rubydevguide]. 

I also authored three out of ten chapters. To my knowledge it was the second or
third english book published about Ruby.

ISBN: 1-928994-64-4. 693 pages.
